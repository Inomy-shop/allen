## Packages

### `packages/engine`

The workflow runtime.

Responsibilities:

- Load workflows from `packages/engine/workflows/`.
- Load the engine's built-in agent and router definitions from `packages/engine/agents.yml` and `router.yml`. (Allen's production agent org is seeded into MongoDB by the server — see [The Seeded Org](#the-seeded-org).)
- Validate YAML workflow structure.
- Render templates and track template bindings.
- Execute human, agent, built-in, condition, and parallel nodes.
- Maintain per-execution state.
- Extract structured outputs from agent responses.
- Attach artifacts to workflow, chat, and agent roots.
- Load MCP server definitions and inject allowed environment variables.
- Run agents through Claude Code CLI or SDK.
- Capture and aggregate provider-reported token usage (input cached, non-cached, and output tokens) per node attempt and at execution level for both Codex and Claude providers.

Important files:

- `src/engine.ts` - core workflow execution.
- `src/node-executor.ts` - node execution and agent invocation.
- `src/codex-executor.ts` and `src/cli-runner.ts` - Claude Code CLI execution paths.
- `src/parallel.ts` - parallel branch coordination.
- `src/condition-parser.ts` - condition node evaluation.
- `src/template.ts` - template rendering and binding capture for node inputs.
- `src/router.ts` - agent routing rules consumed by chat and built-in nodes.
- `src/agents-loader.ts` and `agents.yml` - the engine's built-in agent definitions. The production org (6 teams, 20+ agents) is seeded by `packages/server/src/services/org-seed.ts` into the `agents` and `teams` collections.
- `src/mcp-loader.ts` and `src/mcp-install.ts` - MCP server loading, installation, and `ALLEN_`-prefix env mapping. Supports both Node.js (`.ts`/`.js`/`.mjs`) and Python (`.py`) entry files. Python MCPs get a per-MCP virtual environment at `<ALLEN_HOME>/venvs/<mcpId>/` with `requirements.txt` auto-installed on first spawn (`ensurePythonVenv`). Setting a manual **Command** override opts out of venv management; the user takes ownership of the interpreter.
- `src/output-extractor.ts` - output parsing from model responses.
- `src/state-manager.ts` - persisted execution state.
- `src/learning-manager.ts` - learnings capture, retrieval, and prompt injection.
- `src/clarify-synthesizer.ts` - clarification gate handling for human checkpoints.
- `src/orphan-sweeper.ts` - background sweep of orphaned MCP child processes.
- `src/paths.ts` - resolves `ALLEN_HOME` and `WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR`.
- `src/model-alias.ts` - resolves `ALLEN_MODEL_HAIKU/SONNET/OPUS` overrides.
- `src/validator.ts` and `src/types.ts` - workflow YAML schema and types.
- `src/token-usage.ts` - normalized token usage type (`TokenUsageInfo`), provider normalization helpers (`normalizeCodexUsage`, `normalizeClaudeUsage`), null-aware aggregation (`aggregateTokenUsage`), and child-execution rollup marker helpers (`attachChildTokenUsageMarkers`, `tokenUsageFromChildMarkers`). Central module imported by the executors, engine, and server. Values are independently nullable per sub-field — `null` means "provider did not report", never `0`.
- `workflows/*.yml` - eight runnable workflows: `feature-plan-and-implement`, `bug-fix-by-severity`, `tdd-design-by-severity`, `milestone-implementation-from-prd-tdd`, `self-healing-incident-triage`, `allen-self-healing-monitor-hourly`, `multi-repo-change-orchestration`, `source-prd-to-ui-designs-variations` (Design tab: accepts `output_mode: 'spec_only' | 'prototype'`, `design_session_id`, and `design_repo_path`; when `output_mode='spec_only'` (default) prototype-generation nodes are skipped and only UX options/specs are produced).

### `packages/server`

The API, persistence, orchestration, and integration layer.

Responsibilities:

- Connect to MongoDB and ensure indexes.
- Expose first-run UI bootstrap for the first admin user.
- Seed default teams, agents, and workflows.
- Expose authenticated API routes.
- Manage users, auth, JWTs, password reset, and admin gating.
- Manage repos and workspaces.
- Start workspace terminals and file watchers.
- Serve execution streams, workspace logs, public artifact URLs, and public file URLs.
- Integrate with GitHub, Linear, Slack, MCP, and cron jobs.
- Proxy workspace app previews.

Routes (registered in `packages/server/src/app.ts`):

- `/api/health` - server health probe.
- `/api/auth` - login, refresh, password reset.
- `/api/users` - user management.
- `/api/teams` - teams.
- `/api/agents` - agent definitions.
- `/api/workflows` - workflow definitions.
- `/api/executions` - execution records and SSE streams.
- `/api/repos` - repo registration.
- `/api/workspaces` - workspaces, terminals, file watch, preview proxy.
- `/api/chat` - chat sessions and messages. `POST /sessions` accepts an optional `workspaceId` body field; when supplied, the server calls `WorkspaceManager.linkChat` atomically and returns the session with workspace snapshot fields populated. Includes `POST /sessions/:id/automation-message` (JWT-guarded) for automation agents to append a message to a linked automation thread.
- `/api/mcp` - MCP server registry. Includes `GET /servers/discover/:repoId` (scan a repo for Python and Node MCP entry files) and `POST /servers/:id/reinstall` (bust the install cache and re-run `npm install`; Python MCPs return a skip response instead).
- `/api/linear` - Linear integration.
- `/api/slack` - Slack integration (raw body, signature-verified).
- `/api/pull-requests` - PR list and detail.
- `/api/artifacts` - artifact metadata and content.
- `/api/files` - uploaded file metadata and content.
- `/api/dashboard` - dashboard aggregations.
- `/api/learnings` - learnings store.
- `/api/alerts` - operator alerts.
- `/api/crons` - scheduled jobs.
- `/api/design-docs` - design documents.
- `/api/design` - design sessions, messages, and run dispatch. `GET /sessions` lists design sessions; `POST /sessions` creates one; `POST /sessions/:id/run` resolves routing (full workflow or fast agent), dispatches, and returns `{ designSessionId, messageId, routingDecision, executionId?, agentRunId?, status }`.
- `/api/design/repos` - design repo registry. `GET /repos` lists repos with design roles; `GET /repos/default` returns the default design repo; `POST /repos/onboard` onboards an existing repo; `POST /repos/bootstrap-ui-designs` bootstraps a local `ui-designs` template repo; `PUT/GET /repos/:id/preview-config` manages preview configuration; `POST /repos/:id/preview-config/test` validates preview startup.
- `/api/interventions` - human checkpoint queue.

Important server files:

- `src/app.ts` - HTTP app, route registration, middleware order, WebSocket server bootstrap.
- `src/auth/jwt.ts` — JWT issuance and verification. `signAccessToken(payload, expiresIn?)` accepts an optional `expiresIn` override so callers can request short-lived tokens (e.g. `'5m'`) without bypassing the `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` default for normal user sessions.
- `src/middleware/requireAuth.ts` and `requireAdmin.ts` - route gating.
- `src/services/workspace.service.ts` - workspace lifecycle, port allocation, preview wiring.
- `src/services/workspace-terminal.ts` - shared terminal + file-watch WebSocket on port `4024`.
- `src/services/workspace-watcher.ts` - file watcher attached to the terminal WebSocket.
- `src/services/workspace-proxy.ts` - workspace preview proxy.
- `src/services/github-auth.ts` - GitHub token resolution from `.env`.
- `src/services/linear.service.ts` - Linear GraphQL client, TTL caches, agent/workflow dispatch, and issue fetching.
- `src/services/chat-tools.ts` — Implements all 16+ MCP tool handlers (`spawn_agent`, `wait_for_execution`, `resume_execution`, `allen_save_artifact`, etc.). `resume_execution` resolves the resumed agent's LLM session ID through a three-layer fallback: (1) `executions.sessions[agentName]`, (2) `output.session_id` from the latest `execution_traces` document (sorted `{ completedAt: -1, createdAt: -1 }`), (3) `exec.input.session_id`. When a session ID is found via layer 2 or 3, it is written back to the sessions map before the spawn so future resumes use the fast primary path. Chat-started workflow executions (`source === 'chat'` with a truthy `workflowId`) are routed to the checkpoint-based workflow-resume path rather than the agent-resume path. `spawn_agent` captures provider token usage from Codex `turn.completed` events and Claude SDK `result` messages, aggregates across turns using `aggregateTokenUsage`, and persists the normalized `TokenUsageInfo` onto the execution row.
- `src/services/chat.service.ts` — `resolveMentions()` resolves `@ENG-123`-style tokens to Linear ticket context and `@name` tokens to workflow/repo/agent context before the LLM call. `ChatSession.source` accepts `'ui' | 'slack' | 'automation'`; automation sessions carry an `automationKey` field used as a deduplication key. `appendAutomationMessage(sessionId, role, content)` inserts a message into an automation thread without starting a live LLM session (content capped at 1 MB, `role:admin` rejected, throws `'Not an automation session'` if `session.source !== 'automation'`).
- `src/services/cron.service.ts` — Scheduler using `node-cron`. For agent-target jobs where `agentName === job.name`, `ensureLinkedSession()` upserts a persistent `chat_sessions` document keyed by `automationKey` (race-safe via `$setOnInsert` + E11000 fallback), then injects an `AUTOMATION_CONTEXT` block into the agent prompt (`LINKED_CHAT_SESSION_ID`, `AUTOMATION_API_TOKEN`, `AUTOMATION_MESSAGE_URL`) so the agent can POST its output back to the linked thread. The `AUTOMATION_API_TOKEN` is minted with a 5-minute TTL (via `signAccessToken(..., '5m')`) to avoid persisting a long-lived credential in the `chat_messages` collection. A stale-pointer recovery path re-links `cron_jobs.linkedChatSessionId` if the session was deleted and recreated.
- `src/services/cron-seed.service.ts` — Seeds built-in cron jobs covering repo scans/pulls, PR sync, MCP bundle cleanup, CodeRabbit PR-comment sweeps, and the hourly self-healing monitor. When `SEED_OVERRIDE` is set, display fields and schedules are refreshed on existing rows, but `linkedChatSessionId` is intentionally excluded from the `$set` so any persistent automation chat thread survives restarts.
- `services/slack.service.ts`, `services/slack-notifier.ts` - Slack integrations.
- `src/routes/file.routes.ts` and `routes/artifact.routes.ts` - capability-URL public routes.

Public capability-style routes exist for generated file links, artifact links, execution SSE, workspace log SSE, and workspace previews. See `docs/security.md` before changing them.

### `packages/ui`

The React/Vite frontend.

Responsibilities:

- Login and password reset.
- Dashboard views.
- Chat and agent delegation UX, including `@mention` autocomplete for workflows, repos, agents, and Linear tickets.
- Workflow list and workflow builder.
- Workflow run dialogs.
- Paginated activity feed: server-side execution list (50 per page) with status filter, type filter (agent / workflow), and debounced text search. Page position is encoded in `?page=N` URL state and resets to 0 on filter or search changes. The page auto-refreshes every 5 s while running or queued executions are present.
- Execution timeline, node detail, logs, state, artifacts, checkpoints, interventions, and token usage breakdown (cached input, non-cached input, output tokens — omitted when data is unavailable).
- Workspace list/detail, terminal, file preview, service preview. Clicking a workspace in the sidebar opens `ChatPage` in workspace mode (`/chat?workspaceId=…`) rather than the workspace IDE page, giving a browser-style chat tab strip scoped to that workspace.
- Repo manager.
- Ticket and PR views.
- **Design tab** (`/design`, `/design/:designSessionId`): design-session list, active conversation, composer, routing selector, design/source repo selectors, run-progress panel, artifact list, and optional preview panel. When no design repo is configured, shows a setup panel with options to onboard an existing repo or bootstrap a `ui-designs` template.
- Settings for agents, MCP (including preset and repo-based registration with Python MCP support), integrations, and users.

Key activity page components:

- `src/pages/ExecutionListPage.tsx` - Activity page. Renders the paginated execution list. Exports the `paginationViewModel({ page, total, pageSize })` pure function that computes UI-state (`visible`, `pageCount`, `currentPageLabel`, `prevDisabled`, `nextDisabled`) with no DOM dependency so it can be tested in isolation. A **Source** filter chip group (`All | Chat | Workflow | Design`) filters on `executions.meta.sourceSurface`; design-tab runs carry `sourceSurface='design_tab'`.
- `src/pages/DesignPage.tsx` - Design tab entry point routed at `/design` and `/design/:designSessionId`. Hosts the session list, active conversation, composer, run panel, and routing selector. Renders `DesignSetupPanel` when no design repo is configured.

Key design UI components:

- `src/components/design/DesignSetupPanel.tsx` - empty-state panel with "Onboard existing design/prototyping repo" and "Create from ui-designs template" actions.
- `src/components/design/DesignConversationList.tsx` - left rail listing the user's design sessions.
- `src/components/design/DesignComposer.tsx` - input box and Run button; sends to `POST /api/design/sessions/:id/run`.
- `src/components/design/DesignRoutingSelector.tsx` - shows resolved mode, runner, and reason with a `Change ▾` override menu (`auto | full_workflow | fast_frontend | design_refinement | design_review`). Displays the workflow as `Full design workflow` in the UI without changing the internal name.
- `src/components/design/DesignRepoSelector.tsx` - design repo (required, defaults to `isDefaultDesignRepo`) and source repo (optional) selectors.
- `src/components/design/DesignPreviewConfigForm.tsx` - preview config form; validates working directory, startCommand, portMode, and fixedPort; calls `PUT /preview-config` then optionally `POST /preview-config/test`.
- `src/components/design/DesignRunPanel.tsx` - streams the active run via the existing execution SSE, shows artifacts, and surfaces retry/error options.
- `src/services/designService.ts` - thin `request<T>` wrappers around `/api/design/*`.

Key chat UI components:

- `src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - message composer with model/effort/plan/repo selectors, file attachments, and @mention detection.
- `src/components/chat/MentionAutocomplete.tsx` - autocomplete dropdown with two modes: **default** (workflows, repos, agents filtered by query) and **linear** (activated by `@linear`, shows the user's assigned active tickets with priority dots and state badges).
- `src/components/chat/WorkspaceChatContextBar.tsx` - context bar rendered in workspace-mode chat. Shows workspace name, repo, branch, baseBranch, and worktree path; quick-action button (Open workspace); archived-workspace banner when `status === 'archived'`; hidden in non-workspace chat.
- `src/components/chat/WorkspaceChatTabs.tsx` - horizontal browser-style tab strip for workspace-linked chats. Supports open/close/restore tabs, `+ New Chat` button, and a **Previous chats ▾** dropdown (recent-first, capped at 50 items). Tab labels truncate with a tooltip showing the full title; a streaming indicator appears on live tabs. Close confirmation is shown when the target tab is streaming.
- `src/services/api.ts` `linear` object - typed wrappers for all `/api/linear/*` endpoints including the `assignee: 'me'` filter shorthand.

## The Seeded Org

On startup `packages/server/src/services/org-seed.ts` idempotently seeds the agent organization into the `teams` and `agents` MongoDB collections — this is the agent set Allen runs in production. `packages/engine/agents.yml` holds the engine's built-in default agents, used for development and when the database has not been seeded.

Six teams (lead → parent):

| Team | Lead | Parent | Notable members |
|---|---|---|---|
| `executive` | `ceo` | — | the CEO orchestrator |
| `product` | `product-manager` | executive | `requirements-analyst`, `acceptance-tester`, `brainstormer` |
| `engineering` | `engineering-lead` | executive | `backend-developer`, `frontend-developer`, `devops-engineer`, `pr-creator`, `code-reviewer`, `security-specialist`, `documentation-writer`, `codebase-navigator` |
| `quality` | `qa-lead` | executive | `test-planner`, `test-writer` |
| `meta` | `team-builder-agent` | — | `agent-builder-agent`, `workflow-builder-agent`, `research-agent`, `planner-agent`, `repo-scanner` |
| `unassigned` | `unassigned-coordinator` | executive | holding area for imported/created agents |

Agent categories:

- **Team leads / orchestrators** — no filesystem access; plan and delegate (`ceo`, `product-manager`, `engineering-lead`, `qa-lead`, `team-builder-agent`, `unassigned-coordinator`).
- **Specialist / technical agents** — filesystem + terminal; do the hands-on work (developers, reviewer, security, docs, navigator, testers, analysts, plus supporting agents like `bug-investigator`, `solution-architect`, `technical-designer`, `implementation-validator`, `pr-review-bot`, `pr-workspace-resolver`).
- **Automation / monitoring agents** — Allen-internal self-healing: `allen-monitoring-agent`, `allen-incident-router`, `allen-memory-diagnostician`, `allen-tooling-diagnostician`, `allen-workflow-diagnostician`, `allen-prompt-instruction-diagnostician`.

Re-seeding is idempotent. Set `SEED_OVERRIDE=true` to refresh existing seeded rows from code on next boot.

## Data Model

MongoDB stores all operational state. Collections are created and indexed by server startup code (`packages/server/src/database/indexes.ts`). The main collections:

- **Auth** — `users`, `refresh_tokens` (TTL auto-purge), `bootstrap_locks` (first-admin race guard).
- **Org** — `teams`, `agents`, `skills`.
- **Workflows & executions** — `workflows`, `executions`, `execution_traces`, `execution_logs`, `execution_failure_reports`, `checkpoints`. Both `executions` and `execution_traces` rows carry an optional `tokenUsage: { inputCachedTokens, inputNonCachedTokens, outputTokens }` field (each sub-field is `number | null`) that is populated when the provider reports usage data. Old rows without this field render and behave normally.
- **Chat** — `chat_sessions` (automation sessions carry a sparse-unique `automationKey`; the linked `_id` is stored as `cron_jobs.linkedChatSessionId` and never overwritten by seed updates; workspace-linked sessions carry `workspaceId` plus snapshot fields `workspaceName`, `workspaceRepoId`, `workspaceRepoName`, `workspaceBranch`, `workspaceBaseBranch`, `workspacePrNumber`, `workspacePrUrl` written by `WorkspaceManager.linkChat`), `chat_messages`, `agent_conversations` (delegation threads), `agent_activity` (7-day TTL).
- **Docs & checkpoints** — `design_docs` (PRD/HLD/TDD), `workflow_interventions`.
- **Design tab** — `design_sessions` (`kind='design'`, `sourceSurface='design_tab'`; carries `designRepoId`, optional `sourceRepoId`/`workspaceId`, `status`, `routingDecision`, `lastExecutionId`, `hasExistingOutputs`, and `outputMode`), `design_messages` (per-session messages with optional `routingDecision`, `executionId`, `agentRunId`, and `artifacts`). Design sessions are separate from `chat_sessions` so normal chat history excludes design conversations by default.
- **Repos & workspaces** — `repos` (extended with optional `roles: RepoRole[]`, `isDefaultDesignRepo?: boolean`, and `designPreviewConfig?: DesignPreviewConfig` for design-tab support), `repo_contexts`, `pull_requests`, `workspaces`, `workspace_configs`.
- **MCP & secrets** — `mcp_servers`, `secrets`.
- **Scheduling & alerts** — `cron_jobs`, `cron_runs` (90-day TTL), `alerts`.
- **Learning** — `learnings`, `memory_injection_audits`.
- **Self-healing** — `monitoring_incidents` (unique `fingerprint`), `monitoring_scan_state`, `monitoring_events`, `monitoring_evidence_bundles`.
- **Slack** — `slack_thread_mappings`, `slack_processed_events` (24h TTL idempotency).

## Workflow Lifecycle

1. User starts a workflow from the UI or another trigger.
2. Server creates an execution record in MongoDB.
3. Engine loads the workflow YAML and initial input.
4. Nodes run in order, with condition and parallel support.
5. Agent nodes spawn Claude Code CLI or SDK sessions.
6. Human nodes create interventions/checkpoints when input is required.
7. Node logs and state changes stream to the UI.
8. Outputs and artifacts are persisted.
9. Final status and summaries are visible in the execution detail page.

## Workspace Lifecycle

Allen workspaces are local worktrees under the workspace base directory.

Typical flow:

1. A repo is registered.
2. A workspace is created from a repo and branch.
3. Allen allocates a port block for workspace services.
4. Agents work inside the workspace path.
5. Terminal and file watch WebSockets attach to the workspace.
6. Preview proxy routes expose workspace services in the UI.
7. Stale PIDs are cleaned up on server boot.

**Workspace-linked chat.** Clicking a workspace in the sidebar navigates to `/chat?workspaceId=<id>`. `ChatPage` bootstraps in workspace mode: it fetches the workspace document and its linked chat sessions, opens them as a browser-style tab strip (recent-first), and selects the most recently active tab. If no chats exist, a `New chat` temp tab is created. Sending the first message from a temp tab calls `POST /api/chat/sessions` with `workspaceId`, which links the new session and snapshots workspace metadata in one round-trip. The session's `workspaceId` is used by the agent cwd resolver so all agents in that chat run with `cwd = workspace.worktreePath`. Navigating to a `/chat/:sessionId` URL whose session has a `workspaceId` also bootstraps workspace mode and forces that session active, enabling Dashboard-driven resumption.

Defaults:

- Workspace base: resolved by `WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR` or Allen's default home paths.
- Port blocks: start at `15000`, with 10 ports per workspace.
- Terminal WebSocket: `4024` (overridable via `TERMINAL_WS_PORT`).
- File watch: shares the terminal WebSocket on port `4024` at `/ws/workspaces/:id/watch`.

## Agent Execution

Allen supports Claude Code CLI and SDK execution.

Default behavior:

- Claude-provider execution uses CLI mode by default.
- `ALLEN_AGENT_EXECUTION_MODE=cli` keeps the default explicit.
- `ALLEN_AGENT_EXECUTION_MODE=sdk` forces the in-process SDK path.
- `CLAUDE_BIN` can point to a specific Claude binary.
- `ALLEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MODE=append` preserves Claude Code scaffolding and appends Allen's role prompt.
- `ALLEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MODE=custom` fully replaces the system prompt where supported.

## Integrations

Allen has integration paths for:

- GitHub tokens and pull request workflows.
- Linear ticket dispatch and chat @mention resolution.
- Slack thread/chat handling and human intervention notifications.
- MCP server presets and custom MCP servers.
- Cron-driven background tasks.

Integration credentials are read from `.env`. MCP servers use the `ALLEN_` prefix convention: an MCP-required key like `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is read from `ALLEN_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and forwarded to the MCP subprocess without the prefix. Both Node.js and Python MCP servers follow this model. Python MCPs require `python3` (or a custom bootstrap interpreter) on `PATH`; Allen creates an isolated venv per MCP at `<ALLEN_HOME>/venvs/<mcpId>/` and installs `requirements.txt` into it on first spawn. To update deps, click **Reinstall** in Settings → MCP Servers (wipes the venv) or delete and re-add the MCP. A manual **Command** override (e.g. pointing at an existing project venv) opts out of Allen-managed venv creation.

### Linear Integration

Requires `ALLEN_LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`. The `LinearService` (`packages/server/src/services/linear.service.ts`) wraps Linear's GraphQL API in read/write mode with short-lived TTL caches (status: 5 min, projects: 1 min, issues: 30 s) to stay within Linear's 4500 req/hr rate limit.

**API routes (`/api/linear`):**

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/status` | Check whether Linear is configured and return workspace info. |
| `GET` | `/projects` | List all Linear projects. |
| `GET` | `/issues` | List issues with optional filters: `projectId`, `state` (comma-separated state types), `q` (full-text search), `limit`, `assignee=me`. |
| `GET` | `/issues/:id` | Fetch a single issue by Linear ID. |
| `PATCH` | `/issues/:id/assign-agent` | Store a local agent assignment for a ticket. Body: `{ agentName: string \| null }`. |
| `POST` | `/issues/:id/dispatch` | Create an isolated git worktree from a chosen repo, wait for it to become active, then spawn an agent with the ticket body as the prompt. Body: `{ agentName, repoId, extraInstructions?, promptTemplate? }`. Returns HTTP 202 with the initial `pending` assignment; the UI polls `/issues/:id` for progress. |
| `POST` | `/issues/:id/dispatch-workflow` | Start a registered workflow with the ticket's metadata injected into the input. Body: `{ workflowId, input }`. Returns HTTP 202 with the assignment. |

**`assignee=me` filter:** when `assignee=me` is passed, the route resolves it to the authenticated user's email from the JWT and forwards it as a Linear `assignee.email.eq` filter.

**Chat @mention resolution:** when a chat message contains a token matching `@[A-Z]+-\d+` (e.g. `@ENG-123`), `resolveMentions()` in `chat.service.ts` fetches the issue from Linear (up to 3 tickets per message, description capped at 800 chars) and injects a context block into the LLM conversation before any workflow/repo/agent mentions are resolved. If Linear is not configured or the identifier is not found, the token is silently skipped.

**Chat @mention autocomplete:** the `ChatInput` component detects when the user types `@linear` and switches `MentionAutocomplete` into linear mode. In linear mode the component fetches the authenticated user's assigned active tickets (`started,unstarted,backlog`, limit 25) via the `/api/linear/issues?assignee=me&state=…&limit=25` endpoint. Selecting a ticket inserts `@ENG-123` into the message text. Each row shows a priority dot, the identifier, the issue title, and a colour-coded state badge.

### Automation Agents

Cron jobs with `target.type === 'agent'` and `target.agentName === job.name` follow the **automation convention**. On every dispatch:

1. `CronService.ensureLinkedSession()` upserts a `chat_sessions` document with `source: 'automation'` and `automationKey: job.name`. The upsert is idempotent (MongoDB `$setOnInsert` + E11000 race fallback). The resulting session `_id` is written to `cron_jobs.linkedChatSessionId` (only on first creation or after stale-pointer recovery).
2. The cron service mints a **5-minute** admin JWT (`signAccessToken({ role: 'admin', ... }, '5m')`) for the `cron-system` principal and appends an `AUTOMATION_CONTEXT` block to the agent prompt. The short TTL ensures the token stored in `chat_messages` cannot be exploited after the agent finishes:

   ```text
   LINKED_CHAT_SESSION_ID: <sessionId>
   AUTOMATION_API_TOKEN: <token>
   AUTOMATION_MESSAGE_URL: http://localhost:<PORT>/api/chat/sessions/<sessionId>/automation-message
   ```

3. The agent uses `AUTOMATION_MESSAGE_URL` to `POST` its results back with `{ role: 'assistant', content: '...' }`. The endpoint validates the JWT via the global `requireAuth` middleware, applies an in-memory rate limit of 60 req/min per caller sub (→ 429), restricts `role` to `user` or `assistant` (→ 400), rejects requests targeting non-automation sessions (→ 403), enforces a 1 MB content cap (→ 400), and sanitises unexpected errors to `'Internal server error'` so internal details are not leaked.

The persistent linked chat thread accumulates every run's output in one scrollable session, visible directly at `/chat/<sessionId>`.

No agent-targeted automation jobs ship as built-ins. Users can author their own automation agents and create cron jobs that target them through the UI.

### Built-in cron jobs

`cron-seed.service.ts` seeds five system jobs:

| Name | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-scan-daily` | `0 5 * * *` | Re-scan repos whose HEAD changed. |
| `repo-pull-30min` | `*/30 * * * *` | `git pull` origin for registered repos. |
| `pr-sync-30min` | `*/30 * * * *` | Sync PR list via `gh pr list`. |
| `mcp-bundle-cleanup-hourly` | `0 * * * *` | Delete orphaned uploaded MCP bundles >24h old. |
| `allen-self-healing-monitor-hourly` | `17 * * * *` | Launch the hourly self-healing monitor workflow. |
